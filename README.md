# Implementation of Face Detection and Counting Using Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry NoIR Camera

**Description:**
The implementation focuses on utilizing the Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry NoIR camera for face detection and counting purposes. The objective is to create a system capable of detecting human faces in images or videos and accurately counting the number of detected faces. The method employed involves a computer vision-based face detection algorithm utilizing the OpenCV library. The Raspberry Pi 4 serves as the central platform for executing the system, while the Raspberry NoIR camera is employed to capture images or videos for subsequent analysis.

**Method:**
During the implementation phase, a Python program is developed to establish a connection between the Raspberry Pi 4 and the Raspberry NoIR camera. This program accesses the camera, initiates the face detection process, and performs face counting. Additionally, integration with the Antares platform is implemented to facilitate the transmission of face detection data.

**Results:**
Testing demonstrates the system's high accuracy in detecting human faces and correctly counting the number of faces. The system operates efficiently on the Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry NoIR camera, yielding satisfactory face detection outcomes. Moreover, the system successfully sends face detection data to the Antares platform within the specified delay.

**Applications:**
This research project holds extensive potential across various fields, including security surveillance, data analysis, and face recognition. The practical implementation of face detection technology contributes significantly to the advancement of utilizing Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry NoIR camera setups.
